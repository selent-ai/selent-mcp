# Meraki Compliance Tools

## Overview

The ComplianceTools class provides automated compliance checking for Meraki networks against major regulatory standards and frameworks. It analyzes network configurations, security settings, and operational practices to identify compliance gaps and provide actionable recommendations.

## Supported Compliance Standards

### 1. **PCI DSS v4.0** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)

- **Purpose**: Protect cardholder data
- **Key Checks**:
  - Network segmentation and firewall rules
  - Encryption for data in transit
  - Access control measures
  - Logging and monitoring
  - Security testing configurations

### 2. **HIPAA Security Rule** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)

- **Purpose**: Protect patient health information (PHI)
- **Key Checks**:
  - Administrative safeguards (access controls, workforce security)
  - Technical safeguards (encryption, audit controls, integrity)
  - Physical safeguards (device controls, media handling)

### 3. **SOC 2 Type II** (Service Organization Control 2)

- **Purpose**: Ensure service provider security
- **Trust Service Criteria**:
  - Security: Protection against unauthorized access
  - Availability: System availability for operation
  - Processing Integrity: Complete and accurate processing
  - Confidentiality: Protection of confidential information

### 4. **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** (Information Security Management System)

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive information security management
- **Control Categories**:
  - Organizational controls (A.5)
  - People controls (A.6)
  - Physical controls (A.7)
  - Technological controls (A.8)

### 5. **NIST Cybersecurity Framework v1.1**

- **Purpose**: Improve critical infrastructure cybersecurity
- **Core Functions**:
  - Identify: Asset management and risk assessment
  - Protect: Access control and data security
  - Detect: Continuous monitoring and anomaly detection
  - Respond: Incident response capabilities
  - Recover: Recovery planning and resilience

4. **run_iso_27001_compliance_check**

   - Assesses ISO 27001 control implementation
   - Covers organizational, technological, people, and physical controls
   - References specific ISO control numbers

5. **run_nist_compliance_check**

### Comprehensive Reporting

**generate_compliance_report**

- Runs multiple compliance checks in one operation
- Generates consolidated findings across standards
- Provides executive summary with overall score
- Prioritizes recommendations by urgency

## Key Features

### Automated Checks

The tools automatically analyze:

- Firewall configurations and rules
- Wireless encryption settings
- VLAN segmentation
- Administrator access controls and MFA
- Logging and monitoring configurations
- IDS/IPS settings
- VPN configurations
- Device inventory and firmware status

### Compliance Scoring

- Overall compliance percentage
- Per-requirement/criteria scoring
- Pass/Fail/Partial status determination
- Severity-based finding classification

### Actionable Output

Each check provides:

- Specific findings with context
- Severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Control/requirement references
- Actionable recommendations
- Remediation guidance

## Usage Examples

### Check PCI DSS Compliance

```python
# Check entire organization
result = await compliance_tools.run_pci_dss_compliance_check(
    organization_id="123456"
)

# Check specific network
result = await compliance_tools.run_pci_dss_compliance_check(
    organization_id="123456",
    network_id="N_123456789"
)
```

### Generate Multi-Standard Report

```python
# Full compliance assessment
report = await compliance_tools.generate_compliance_report(
    organization_id="123456",
    standards=["PCI_DSS", "HIPAA", "SOC2", "ISO_27001", "NIST"],
    executive_summary=True
)
```

## Understanding Results

### Compliance Status

- **PASS**: Fully compliant (100% or critical controls met)
- **PARTIAL**: Partially compliant (some gaps identified)
- **FAIL**: Non-compliant (critical failures detected)

### Finding Severity

- **CRITICAL**: Immediate action required (e.g., no encryption, open access)
- **HIGH**: Significant risk requiring prompt attention
- **MEDIUM**: Notable gaps that should be addressed
- **LOW**: Minor issues or optimization opportunities
- **INFO**: Informational findings

### Recommendations Priority

- **Immediate Actions**: Critical security gaps requiring urgent remediation
- **Short Term**: Important improvements to implement soon
- **Long Term**: Strategic enhancements for better security posture

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Assessments**: Run compliance checks monthly or quarterly
2. **Track Progress**: Monitor compliance percentage trends over time
3. **Prioritize Remediation**: Address critical findings first
4. **Document Actions**: Keep records of remediation efforts
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Use recommendations to enhance security posture

## Integration with Meraki Dashboard

The ComplianceTools integrate seamlessly with the Meraki Dashboard API to:

- Automatically discover and assess all networks
- Analyze real-time configurations
- Provide specific device and network context
- Generate evidence for compliance audits

## Limitations

- Physical security controls can only be partially assessed
- Some procedural requirements need manual verification
- Compliance is assessed at a point in time
- Full compliance requires both technical and procedural controls

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions include:

- GDPR compliance checking
- CIS Controls assessment
- Custom compliance frameworks
- Automated remediation capabilities
- Compliance trending and analytics
- Integration with ticketing systems
